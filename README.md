# AmnesiaMusicPlayer

A music player for the artists. Keep track of scattered musical ideas, so you can eventually turn them into full songs!

Made using Flutter and Dart.

I can't use Developer Mode, so I have downloaded and unpackaged the following packages:
 - file-picker (https://pub.dev/packages/file_picker)
 - plugin-platform-interface (https://pub.dev/packages/plugin_platform_interface)
 - context-menus (https://pub.dev/packages/context_menus)
