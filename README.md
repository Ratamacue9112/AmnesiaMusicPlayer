# AmnesiaMusicPlayer

A music player for the artists. Keep track of scattered musical ideas, so you can eventually sort them into full songs!

Made using Flutter and Dart. Only for windows.

There is a lot of issues, especially with the audio player. I am no longer working on the project, but will still accept pull requests if anyone wants to contribute.
